            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up Your Trezor Wallet</h2>
            <p>Follow these steps to successfully set up your Trezor hardware wallet and secure your cryptocurrency.</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Unbox Your Trezor</h3>
            <p>After purchasing your Trezor, unbox the device and ensure that all necessary components are present: the Trezor device, a USB cable, recovery seed cards, and an instruction manual.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Visit Trezor.io/start</h3>
            <p>Once unboxed, navigate to <a href="https://trezor.io/start" target="_blank">Trezor.io/start</a>. This page will guide you through the setup process. Whether you're using the Trezor Model T or the Trezor One, this portal will provide customized instructions for your specific device.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Download and Install Trezor Suite</h3>
            <p>To manage your assets securely, you’ll need to install the Trezor Suite software, which is available for desktop and web usage. This software allows you to connect, manage, and monitor your cryptocurrency portfolio easily. Download Trezor Suite from the official <a href="https://suite.trezor.io" target="_blank">Trezor Suite website</a> to get started.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Connect Your Trezor to Your Computer</h3>
            <p>Using the USB cable, connect your Trezor hardware wallet to your computer. Once connected, Trezor Suite will recognize the device and walk you through the necessary steps for initial setup.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Create a PIN and Backup Your Wallet</h3>
            <p>During the setup, you will be prompted to create a secure PIN for accessing your device. The next step is the backup process, where you will be given a recovery seed — a unique 12 or 24-word phrase that allows you to recover your wallet if it's lost or damaged. Be sure to store this recovery seed offline in a safe place, as it is your only way to recover your assets.</p>

            <h3>Step 6: Start Managing Your Crypto</h3>
            <p>Once setup is complete, you can start receiving, sending, and managing your cryptocurrencies with peace of mind. Trezor supports a wide range of digital assets, including popular coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.</p>
